## Project Description
For this work I used a database with sales information available on the internet. I created a story telling to provide context and purpose as the main objective was to make interactive dashboards.

## Steps
  - I first worked in Python for data cleaning and to get an overview of the data.
  - Then I used Tableau to dig deeper into the data, create charts and an interactive dashboards.

## Conclusion
  - Dashboards were built with filters that allow user to easily visualize sales by geographic, customer and product line. All information is available both in percentages and in values.

  - Financial analysis shows annual growth of 34%, churn below 2% and forecast indicating continued sales growth. An important point of attention is sales below the manufacturer's suggested price. In the first year they represented 5% of total sales, rising to 8.4% in the second year and reaching 12.3% in the current year. It would be advisable to have access to more financial data to analyze the company's profitability.
